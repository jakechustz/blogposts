# That Time I Was Dora For Halloween
#### Oh yes. I did that. 
My senior year of high school, I decided that I want to be grown up Dora the Explorer for Halloween. Who knows where the idea came from, but I just knew that I had to do it. Because why not? Plus I went to an arts school that went full out on Halloween, so you basically had to dress up. I saw a kid get thrown into a garbage can one Halloween because they weren't dressed up. Yes, that was definitely not the right thing to do but I wanted to give you a picture of how serious this school was about this holiday. I had everything I needed to make this day a success. 

* 5 inch pumps
* orange shorts
* pink top
* purple shawl (as an optional prop)
* the WIG
* that flower
* shaved legs 
So listen. I didn't have Boots, the Map, or the Backpack, but I still feel like I pulled off a **LEWK**. See below!

Oh yes. I did that. And I absolutely did walk up 6 flights of stairs in those heels. HA

At the end of the day, yes the costume made me feel confident and exciting, but my friends are the ones who made me feel loved and supported. And in the end, that's all we're lookin for. Go out and live your best you.
